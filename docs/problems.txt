1. Looking for dataset on kaggle --> looks promising --> becomes shit after more curious inspection. Pictures were 360 degrees pictures of one fruit and not 360 pictures of many fruits.

2. Tensorflow compatibility problems with M1 mac processor --> initial training setup was unsucessfull, error wasn't to be found. Later discovered that Tensorflow doesn't support M1-processor compatibility because the structure is different.
   Tried work-around but this messes up the formation of the introductionary video --> training on weaker windows pc.

3. Labeling of dataset -> small/simple, huge/tedious. Package of python found which does the thing for you. Needs a trained model obviously Probelm: trained model by tensorflow object detection api is not compatible with normal tensorflow operations. Therefore either do 
   it manually, train a different model thats not pretrained or use an online tool.

4. Compatibility with Mac machines regarding the setup because the api is rather hard to install there
